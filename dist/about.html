        <p>
            I am a 2nd-year Computer Science student at City St George’s, University of London, with
            a strong interest in technology, web development, and improving digital interactions. 
            In addition to my academic journey, I have studied Full Stack Web Development at 
            Trybe, a web development school.
            <br /><br />
            I am passionate about creating solutions that have a positive impact on people’s lives. 
            Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy computer games, board games, Middle-earth lore, 
            and cyberpunk themes. I also love going to pubs, enjoying a pint, and having engaging 
            conversations about geopolitics.

        <h4>Network Technician Student</h4>
        <h6>2007</h6>
        <p>
        The Computer Network Technician implements and maintains an infrastructure, access equipment
        , operating systems and computer network services, applying network security standards and 
        technical standards, in accordance with quality, health and work safety and environmental 
        preservation.
        <br /><br />
        The professional works in public, private and third sector institutions that demand computer 
        networks or in the autonomous provision of services, with an emphasis on the environment, 
        thus enabling the professional to monitor network projects, implement, manage and administer 
        specific services network, both in the physical and in the logical part, always trying to 
        keep the data and computer network secure. 
        <br /><br />
        Self-employment is also a market alternative, as small companies, which cannot keep 
        professionals full-time, hire service providers for implementation, support and 
        administration.
